# flights_search
This simple web scraping project compares flight prices for future dates among the three major airlines operating the GRU <-> SDU route. Each .py file corresponds to the scraping code for a different airline. The report.py file generates a Plotly chart to visualize the data comparison.

The project was designed as a quick investigation to determine how early one should book to avoid high prices. It also served as an opportunity to develop web scraping skills.

Note: The scraping scripts may no longer function due to updates on the airline websites. These scripts were last tested successfully on 2023-02-02.
